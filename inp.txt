Today I want to tell you about High educdtion in uk.
First of all, you have to study full course at school.
It’s pretty simple process, but the most interest thing is application process.
Some days ago I asked my friend Kirill. We were studying in local Siberian school
for 9 years. After 9 years of secondary education he moved to UK to finish school
and apply to college. I will tell you direct information. First of all, 12-13 years
in British school can be meant as 10-11 grade in Russia. During 12th years, you can
try yourself at exams(A and AB format). Kirill have passed A-level(3 subjects).
Joining 13th year, you apply to 5 universities writing your CV with personal information
and exam results. After April-May universities gives you a letter with prediction of your
application. Then you have to choose 2 of them in personal order. After that you get final
grade on special exams, and college decides. That’s all about admision. The most popular
bachelor program lasts 3 years (it’s much more fast than studying 4 years: in that case you
learn two years, than get a work from college for year and study one more year). Also, postgraduate
education can be finished after one more year
